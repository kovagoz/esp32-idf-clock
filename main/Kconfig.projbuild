        GPIO number (IOxx) for CLK pin of TM1637 display.

        Some GPIOs are used for other purposes (flash connections, etc.) and cannot be used.

        GPIOs 35-39 are input-only so cannot be used to drive the One Wire Bus.

        For ESP8266, GPIO 5 is a good choice.

config TM1637_DIO_PIN
    int "TM1637 lcd DIO pin GPIO number"
    range 0 34

    help
        GPIO number (IOxx) for DIO pin of TM1637 display.

        Some GPIOs are used for other purposes (flash connections, etc.) and cannot be used.

        GPIOs 35-39 are input-only so cannot be used to drive the One Wire Bus.

        For ESP8266, GPIO 4 is a good choice.
